# UQ Racing Driverless Control project.

Project to control car given known trajectory. <br/>
Technologies: ROS, C++, Python, Linux (Ubuntu)

This image shows the calculated curvature from which to control the car's velocity.

This image shows different speed profiles used to control the car velocity.

This gif shows the controller in action.
The top text shows the current speed, and the bottom text shows the current lookahead distance for the pure pursuit controller.
